Form challenge/response spam shield
===================================

**Note, that this TYPO3 extension is in beta state. Use at own risk on production websites.**

## What is it?

Form challenge/response spam shield is a TYPO3 extension to prevent automated form submissions
in TYPO3 form extension. 

### How does it work?

Form challenge/response spam shield adds a hidden input field to every form generated by the TYPO3 form
extension. The input field contains a data-attribute with a challenge. The included JavaScript will
use the challenge to calculate an expected response which will be checked on every form submission.
If the expected response is not submitted, validation for the hidden input field is considered as
failed and no email will be sent.

### Requirements

The extension uses JavaScript to calculate the expected response, so if JavaScript is disabled on client
side, form submission will not be possible.

A modern webbrowser is required to run the JavaScript. Internet Explorer < 11 is not supported.

### Installation

Just install the extension on your TYPO3 website using composer or the TYPO3 extension manager.
No further configuration is required.

### Logging

In order to log failed requests, it is possible to use a dedicated logfile like shown below:

```
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['LOG']['Derhansen']['FormCrshield']['Hooks']['Form']['writerConfiguration'] = [
    \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::DEBUG => [
        \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\Writer\FileWriter::class => [
            'logFile' => \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Environment::getVarPath() . '/log/form-crshield.log',
        ]
    ]
];
```
